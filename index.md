#### In a nutshell
* For COVID-19 and Thoracic pathology neural network classification/regression models, we first identify the concepts (e.g. pathologies) associated with internal units (feature maps) of the network

  We investigate the following questions:
* Does a regression model that is only trained with COVID-19 severity scores implicitly learn visual patterns associated with thoracic pathologies?
* Does a network that is trained on weakly labeled data (e.g. healthy, unhealthy) implicitly learn pathologies (e.g. Consolidation)?

* We also investigate the effect of pretraining and data imbalance on the interpretability of learned features
